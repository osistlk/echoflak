# EchoFlak

EchoFlak is a specialized tool designed to address the common issue of duplicate video clips generated by NVIDIA Highlights, particularly focusing on auto-captured aircraft death scenes in War Thunder. This Node.js package automates the identification, management, and removal of these duplicates, streamlining video management and enhancing the quality of War Thunder video archives.

## Features

- **Automated Detection**: Quickly identifies duplicate video clips created by NVIDIA Highlights.
- **Efficient Management**: Organizes and removes duplicate clips to clear up storage space and declutter your video library.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple setup and execution process, designed with both technical and non-technical War Thunder enthusiasts in mind.

## Using AI

EchoFlak leverages AI technology, specifically in generating perceptual hashes of video frames, to accurately detect duplicates among a large collection of video clips. This approach ensures high precision in identifying similarities, minimizing false positives, and streamlining the video management process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system.
- **FFmpeg**: EchoFlak requires a valid local FFmpeg installation for keyframe extraction and video concatenation. Ensure that FFmpeg is installed and its executable is accessible from your system's PATH.
- **NVIDIA Highlights setup**: For capturing War Thunder gameplay clips.
